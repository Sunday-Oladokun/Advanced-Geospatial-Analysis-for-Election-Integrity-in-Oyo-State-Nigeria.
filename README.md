# Advanced Geospatial Analysis for Election Integrity in Oyo State, Nigeria

This project utilizes geospatial analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to examine the 2023 Presidential Election results in Oyo State, Nigeria, and identify potential electoral irregularities. [cite: 14, 15]

## Key Objectives

* Detect statistical outliers in voting results using spatial autocorrelation measures. [cite: 16]
   
* Identify geographic clusters of irregularities through DBSCAN clustering. [cite: 17]
   
* Validate anomalies using machine learning (Isolation Forest). [cite: 17]
   
* Contextualize findings through historical and demographic comparisons. [cite: 18]

## Methodology

The analysis involves a four-stage pipeline:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Geocoding polling units using Google Maps API and cleaning the dataset. [cite: 26, 27]
   
2.  **Spatial Analysis:** Applying HDBSCAN clustering to group polling units and using Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi\* for outlier detection. [cite: 27, 28, 29]
   
3.  **Machine Learning Validation:** Training an Isolation Forest model to detect global anomalies. [cite: 29, 30]
   
4.  **Contextualization:** Comparing 2023 results with historical data and mapping anomalies to socio-economic indicators. [cite: 30, 31]

## Results

Key deliverables include:

* Geocoded dataset with outlier scores. [cite: 31, 32]
   
* Prioritized list of high-risk polling units. [cite: 32, 33]
   
* Interactive dashboard for visualizing clusters and anomalies. [cite: 33, 34]
   
* Analytical report with findings and recommendations. [cite: 33, 34]

## Impact

This project provides a framework for electoral authorities to efficiently audit irregularities and enhance transparency in the electoral process. [cite: 138, 139, 140, 141]
